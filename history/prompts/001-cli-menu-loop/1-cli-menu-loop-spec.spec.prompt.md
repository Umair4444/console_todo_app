# CLI Menu Loop Feature Specification

## Prompt

```
now i want my app to run in a loop and give all option to user as a list in cli and user can select the option and the loop stop with pressing x or X twicw or esc key or select exit in the list
```

## Response

Created a comprehensive feature specification for implementing a CLI menu loop system that allows users to interact with the todo application through a continuous menu system. The specification includes:

- User scenarios for interactive menu navigation and exit functionality
- Functional requirements for menu display, option selection, and exit conditions
- Success criteria for measuring the feature's effectiveness
- Edge cases to consider during implementation

The specification follows the template structure and is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

Specification document created at specs/001-cli-menu-loop/spec.md with all required sections completed. Quality checklist created and all validation items passed.
